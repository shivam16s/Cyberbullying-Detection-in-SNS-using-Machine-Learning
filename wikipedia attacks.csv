If you don't understand that, fine, legitimate criticism, I'll write up ``three man cell`` and ``bounty hunter`` and then it will be easy to understand why ``ensured`` and ``insured`` are different - and why both differ from ``assured``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.

8,"`:If you ever claimed in a Judaic studies program that ultra-Orthodox Jews don't have rabbis, or don't have synagogues, you would be laughed out of the room. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building. You can laugh all you want, but it doesnt change the facts. It may seem strange to you, but take the statement to anyone who actually knows something. I want to know who laughs then. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:If you ever claimed in a recognized Judaica studies program that a significant number of ultra-Orthodox rabbis accept and follow Modern Orthodox responsa (instead of their own), people would look at you as if you had two heads. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Also a silly point. If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about. A) That statement is false, because responsa in Orthodoxy does not work on the basis of someone's synagogue affiliation. B) What is a Modern Orthodox responsa versus an ultra-Orthodox responsa? C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter. Ovadya Yoseph said women could wear pants instead of skirts. Would any of his daughters or daughters-in-law be caught dead in pants? No way. They are machmir. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You just can't make this stuff up, Danny. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I dunno. I seem to be giving answers to everything you say, and my answers are based on sources. I am not making things up. I am simply stating things that (no matter how inconceivable it may be) you do not know.

I think I have a sense of what NPOV is, and a statement that the ultra-Orthodox ``hate`` the non-ultra-Orthodox just doesn't make the mark. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Is beating the shit out of non-Orthodox Jews an act of love? Is calling them ``worse than Hitler`` an act of love? Is accusing them of creating the Holocaust an act of tolerance? Danny, you can protest all you like, but you obviously so immersed in an ultra-Orthodox worldview that you can't see the forest for the trees.

Height is thought to depend very extensively on genetics, for example, but one is not born adult-sized; one must slowly grow up.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe problem is clear in the example: height certainly does manifest itself over time as one ages.

But they are there at birth.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe real problem with using height as an example of something that is ``nature`` but not immediately manifest at birth is that height is of course determined by ``nature`` and'' ``nurture,`` or, if you prefer, genes and environment.  this is the whole point of Boas's important studies on height; height is clearly highly heritable, but children of immigrants to the US had much higher average adult heights than their parents, presumably because of better nutrition in the US.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI believe nature is best understood as things that are indeed innate (present at birth) as long as we recognize that things that are present at birth genetically may manifest themselves over time.

And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`",1

125,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow that the edit war seems to have died down. I just want to add a little about privatization and free market. Even while the neoliberals ofcourse want to put an equal sign between free market and privatization, very few privatizations are ever made that actually increases the competition in the market. Because if the buisness that is sold to private owners has a monopoly before it is sold, it ofcourse will to after it has been privatized. And if the company is sold while it is already subjected to competition it will to after it has been privatized. Indeed, privatization has nothing to do with ``free markets``, but is only a transferment of public property to private hands. Ofcourse that argument will not keep the neoliberals from claiming the Second Return of Messiah as long as we privatize and the Doomsday if we dont. But atleast we do not have to use their rhethorics.  `",0

162,"`NEWLINE_TOKENI've found a misplaced reference showing that ``generatics`` did not start with me in content,NEWLINE_TOKENonly in name. The book, ``Learn from the Masters``, edited by Dwetz, Fauvel, Bekken, Johannsson,NEWLINE_TOKENKatz (Mathematical Association of America, 1991), says on p. 286, ``It was not until 1894 that J.NEWLINE_TOKENTannery introduced the arithmetic of rationals as pairs [vectors] of integers.`` (Jules TanneryNEWLINE_TOKEN(1818-1910), French, is cited ONLINE.)In 1957, I received a grant from the National ScienceNEWLINE_TOKENFoundation to organize the first NSF Workshop in Puerto Rico, planned for high math schoolNEWLINE_TOKENteachers (some from States). I taught ``Foundations of Mathematics``. I was sent papers (laterNEWLINE_TOKENlost) from previous Workshops. One set described Tannery's work and Hamilton's formulation ofNEWLINE_TOKENcomplex numbers as pairs or vectors of reals. The formulator filled in by deriving integers fromNEWLINE_TOKENpairs or vectors of natural numbers. The latter shows how ``the law of signs`` derives fromNEWLINE_TOKENCLOSURE on DEFINED DIFFERENCES (DDs) of naturals  (a - b), s.t. subtrahend is not greater thanNEWLINE_TOKENminuend, hence, a natural number. Critical is multiplication law for DD. From standardNEWLINE_TOKENmultiplication algorithm, find that, for DDs, (a - b) * (c - d) = (a*c + (-b)*(-d)) + (a*(-d) +NEWLINE_TOKEN(-b)*c). Applying, 10 = 5*2 = (9 - 4)*(2 - 0) = 18 + (-4)*(2) + 0 = 10, hence, (-4)*(2) must actNEWLINE_TOKENas a subtrahend -8, leading to ``negative times positive equals negative`` rule. Applying productNEWLINE_TOKENrule to 30 = 6*5 = (9 - 3) - (7 - 2) = (63 + (-3)*(-2)) - (18 + 21) = (63 - 39) + (-3)*(-2) =NEWLINE_TOKEN24 + x = 30, hence, x = 6 = (-3)*(-2), leading to ``negative times negative equals positive`` rule.NEWLINE_TOKENThis is forced by CLOSURE on DDs. However, in the ``Generating arithmetic`` article which INEWLINE_TOKENinitiated, some one put in that CLOSURE is a concept from category theory, very advanceed math.NEWLINE_TOKENYet, the above book, on p. 260, says, ``For Galois (1830), Jordan (1870), and even in Klein'sNEWLINE_TOKEN``Lectures on the Icosohedron`` (1884), groups were defined by the one axiom of closure.

But I think that saying there are similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, say, is not to deny that Nazism is in some vague sense a movement ``of the right`` and Stalinism a movement ``of the left.``  At any rate, ``what was seen at the time as`` is an incredibly awkward phrasing - it's simply bad writing.  As to other changes, things like saying ``this is how the Nazis were different from other Socialists`` is completely POV, in that it says that the Nazis were socialists.  And you can't just cite laws as supporting a point without explaining them at all.  And it would be nice if you could actually cite scholars who discuss similarities between Nazism and socialism, rather than vague ``supporters`` of such arguments (at the very least, those opposed to such comparisons can cite ``the organized socialist movement`` rather easily, although I would agree that there are somewhat similar problems on that side of the debate.)  I also didn't revert many of your wording changes, because I think that some of them actually do do a good job of making the article less POV.  `",1

I want you to know that despite our disagreements, I really appreciate what you're trying to do.  It's difficult for most people to write a truly NPOV article, which is why what Wikipedia does is so great.  By having hundreds of thousands of authors, almost every point of view is represented, and people are forced to compromise, usually resulting in pure truth.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnfortunately, the Holocaust is one of the few subjects where this doesn't work.  It is a subject which should be purely history.  The Nazis kept spectacular notes on everything that they did, and it should be spectacularly easy to say ``this here is exactly what happened.  We know, because of the monthly reports written by Himmler.``  Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers continually show up, most of whom have no interest in truth or even compromise.  They tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda.  This is just who they are.  They cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from Hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``The Jewish Problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the same time, I can't exactly claim to be NPOV either.  It is fairly clear from what I have already written here that I hold Holocaust deniers in no high esteem.  Quite frankly, I find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people.  It is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the United States, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten.  It would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the Jews.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument.  I would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes.  Holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-Semitic.  My personal favourite group believes that Jews are shape shifting lizards from Mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity.  And yes, this group has a following.  The ``Holocaust Revisionist`` lines and the ``Jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door.  The people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-Semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what Hitler started.

Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before.

What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.

I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.

373,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile you are correct that 'toughened glass' could be considered a misnomer (toughness has a specific meaning with regard to the strength of materials), tempering glass is not.  In fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical.  Regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature.  On initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. However, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass.  Prince Rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena.  If a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole.  You can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break.  However if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop.  Thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields.  Chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. Although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used.  For example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass.  Thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 MPa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 MPa.  Chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers. ",1

Do you know where I can find this policy? I'd like to point another user to it, Dittaeva, who goes on major monosyllabic keep sprees from time to time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, sorry to bother you with this, but is there any reasonable way of accessing a VfD debate that is as old as Jan 2004? Anthony talked in the current Hubert Dreyfus debate about this being ``worse than when Sidney Morgenbesser was listed here and deleted.`` For a deleted article, Sidney Morgenbesser was surprisingly bluelinked, I thought, so I went look. Oh, my, what a terrible article. Consists of unpleasant anecdotes and fake references. The subject is a professor  with writer's block. Anyway, the point is, it was put up for deletion 23 Jan 2004, subsequently deleted, and then recreated in  August 2004 (as a stub, by Gzornenplatz.) Anthony added material to it on 15 August. So I wanted to put it up for speedy, but the relevant criterion says ``reposted content that was deleted according to Wikipedia deletion policy`` can be speedied, and how can I tell what the content was? The recreated article probably doesn't in fact technically speaking have the same content, since everybody called the old one ``vanity`` (there's a maybe incomplete record of the Januaray voting on User_talk:Anthony_DiPierro#Stop_the_vanity_insanity|this]] subpage of Anthony's), and the new one is much weirder than that. Oh, look, a learned cunt joke by Christopher Hitchens, how delightful.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway. I wanted to see the Jan voting for myself — Anthony doesn't claim that the copy of it  on  his page is complete — so I tried to burrow back through the huge VfD archive that was created in  May, but it broke when I was about halfway. So that was a wasted half-hour. -( There's got to be an easier way. Or maybe not?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnyway, good morning George. I shouldn't be doing this, I (despairingly) have other things to do. Urgent things. OK, today I'll  list Anthony's baby Sidney Morgenbesser for either speedy or VfD (yes, I will, if it's at all possible, i. e. if you have any answers for my questions above), and cleanup Reverse sexism and read that urgent dissertation chapter.

It makes sense that a nation would extol the virtues of itself, right?  The PRC does not have a cult of personality, does not glorify male youth as fighters, does not glorify female youth as future incubators.  Mysticism is missing from official Chinese pronouncements too.  Also missing is the stated goal of said society.  Left Totalitarian regimes like China see a future where a hierarchy of work-production, and distribution can be overcome once production is more automated with robotics and technology and economic scarcity can be overcome.  Allowing private property is a means towards an end in the case of China (market socialism).  Right Totalitarian regimes see hierarchy as the natural and permanent order of things, and the existence of private property is not a mean to an end, but the end to be preserved within itself.  A broad definition of fascism which would more correctly have to be termed corporatism if we say that mysticism, gender roles, and ideological heritage/stated aims aren't necessary conditions, then that would also allow us to place countries like the U.S since the 1930's, social-democratic Germany, and Keynesian Japan in that category.NEWLINE_TOKENThe main difference between fascism and capitalist-democratic or more benign corporatist states is the right for trade unions and combinations to engage in collective bargaining and even work stopages (strikes) against the immediate consent of the state or business.

The relevations of Khrushchev and Solzhenitsyn are also generally considered to be significant. You seem to feel that simply casting unverified aspersions on a source is sufficient to support exclusion of the material from Wikipedia.

Although you claim that I ``poison the well with unneeded POV implications,`` I would argue that your ambitious language leaves too much open for interpretation and lets Dr. Rice off the hook. Having a NPOV doesn't mean censoring controversial ideas. For example, you removed ``criticized`` from the line ``Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for her boss...`` You make it sound like perhaps it is a good thing that She was out stumping for Bush instead of protecting the homeland. In addition, you removed another line I added that spelt out that there is a ``controversial`` link she perpetuates between Iraq and September 11th. The fact that this is even open for interpretation is beyond me. I believe my additions were in line with the NPOV policy and I have replaced them.

587,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Let me explain the problems in your paragraph, which for ease of reference I include below.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Prime Minister Blair is known in Britain as well as the United States for his personal closeness to US President Bush. The two's coordination is uncanny, rarely ever voicing direct disagreements and presenting united stances on most issues; sometimes with Blair going against the Labour party as well as the majority of British citizens. In May, he backed the controversial Israeli withdrawal plan for the Gaza Strip, a radical departure from traditional British politics toward the region, and a move that put the British government in the position of being the only major nation besides the US to support it. He acquiesced to American requests in October to send Scotland's prestigious Black Watch battalion to Baghdad. Recently, the Prime Minister responded to a question on the environment with a stance very close to what the President Bush's was. This ``special relationship`` between George W. Bush and Tony Blair has drawn a mixed bag of reactions in the UK, but it continues to be strong. In November 2004, the Prime Minister travelled to Washington in hopes of using the close friendship to influence the President's stances on a European summit, environment/climate control, and an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The first sentence is acceptable and is in the article. The second is where the problems start. ``The two's coordination is uncanny`` is the sort of statement one would make about two lovers, and will carry this meaning to readers. As for ``rarely ever voicing direct disagreements``, you will find this in most public utterances in diplomacy, regardless of any actual disagreements. For example read the press conference with Blair and Chirac earlier this month. The issue of dissent within the Labour Party over Blair has already been covered in the article and needs no repeating here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The UK government's support for the Gaza withdrawal plan is hardly ``a radical departure`` and, even if it was such a statement would be POV. See 'The Chariot of Israel' by Harold Wilson for the full story of British support for Israel over the years to 1981. Also, the Israeli Labour Party has supported it, and that carries weight in its British sister party. Then the use of the term 'acquiesced' which is only used in a subservient relationship and is therefore pejorative, as is the insertion of 'prestigious' before the regiment: this reads as if it magnifies any offence because the regiment involved was more distinguished than others. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The remark about the environment lacks any detail but is irrelevant: the UK government policy hasn't changed and is quite distinct from the US, so anything which Blair might have said at a press conference is neither here nor there. Finally we come to a report of Blair's visit to the US which states that it was about the environment (it wasn't - see press conference) and is imprecise. This issue, and the rest of this edit, is better covered in the article as it was, and I have therefore reverted it.  `",0

Shortly before the event, the board of directors vetoed our admission as exhibitors.  Word of our attendance had spread to a minority of Jewish women in the organization who objected to our very presence.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENNOCIRC has exhibited successfully at literally hundreds of conferences locally, regionally, and nationally.  We are asked back year after year.  Without religious prejudice, we provide information about the traumatic effects of circumcision.  We hand out our information pamphlets in a non-confrontational manner to those who approach our table because they are interested in learning about the issue.  Each year, we have a well-received exhibit booth for physicians attending the American Academy of Pediatrics national conference.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENNOCIRC already counts among its supporters hundreds of LLL members and former members.  The silent majority of leaders within League are already on our side.    Attendees who were interested would have  appreciated our information; those who were not interested would have just walked on by.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThe vast majority of boys who are circumcised in the United States are not sons of Jewish or Muslim parents.  Preventing these non-religious circumcisions has always been the primary focus for NOCIRC.  This painful surgery, the most common procedure that baby boys are forced to experience, puts breastfeeding success at risk.  Good chest-to-chest positioning requires mom to press her son’s wounded penis up against her body, and the pain makes him unable or unwilling to nurse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENLa Leche League reported problems with breastfeeding by circumcised infants in their 1981 edition of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding.  In 1996, LLL ratified the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative, along with 25 other organizations.  The organization accepted ten basic principles for mother-friendly care,  including the requirement that service providers must “discourage non-religious circumcision of the newborn.” (on-line at ).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThe breastfeeding relationship does not begin in a vacuum.  In 2002, NOCIRC issued its position statement, “The Effects of Circumcision on Breastfeeding,” available at .  Researchers have found that some male babies are unable to suckle the mother’s breast after circumcision.  The circumcised infant is in pain and is in an exhausted, weakened, and debilitated condition.  The circumcision procedure frequently causes the newborn to withdraw from his environment, interfering with his process of bonding and breastfeeding.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENLa Leche League claims it is a non-sectarian organization.  However, when it comes to circumcision, it is a religious organization.  A few powerful members are keeping clinical data regarding breastfeeding obstacles out of the hands of all members in order to further their personal religious viewpoint.  For six years now they have systematically excluded NOCIRC from simply having a table at their area and national conferences.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTAB_TOKENThe Board of Directors has placed a higher priority on protecting religious circumcision than on breastfeeding success for the 94% of non-Jewish, non-Muslim  moms.

I was not aware of that effort until I saw some of your edits.  I do, however, have to disagree with some of the minor changes you've been making in a couple of paragraphs where the author/editor has chosen to itemize his/her arguments.  For example, at Bee learning and communication, someone wrote ``The primary lines of evidence used by the odor plume advocates are 1) clinical experiments with odorless sugar sources which show that worker bees are unable to recruit to those sources and 2) logical difficulties of a small-scale dance...``   You changed those to ``(1)...`` and ``(2)...``. This may be a small point, but I believe it is stylistically incorrect. Surrounding the number on both sides generally indicates a footnote, not a segmented argument.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm guessing that this is going to create some false positives on the automated list of possible syntax errors but I'm going to revert those changes.

They want to rename this article to something ``neutral`` (i.e. something that doesn't reflect the facts about Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children) and then pad it with sensationalized Zionist POV sections about Palestinian resistance to Zionist aggression.

630,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN§ I got in touch with the owner of the website mentioned above, and he has offered to e-mail me a scanned copy of the map in the book illustration, which shows an intermediate band where the white band occurs near the northern tip of Africa.  I had a closer look at the maps I found in the library, and none of them improves on what was in that website. The one major difference that a revised map probably ought to take account of is the division of Australia into two regions. I'll make overlays to check, but it looks like the only other changes involve reducing 8 zones to 5. If you check out the Cavelli-Sforza map (which I now think is a photo reproduction of the original map) you can easily understand why authors would decide to simplify the number of zones  Cavelli-Sforza's map is o.k. for the lighter half of the shades of skin color, but the darker shades are practically indistinguishable.  Sometimes, if you know where to look, you will see what looks like a little halftoning rather than straight black ink. But for practical purposes the map is pretty useless outside of the values that are shown in the Americas. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN§ In a way it was a good thing that the original map was so washed out. If I hadn't really looked carefully at it I'm pretty sure I'd have missed the white band. The uncorrected map has propagated so many places on the WWW that it's hard to believe the original maker of the digitized image has any objection to others using it.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Cleanup==NEWLINE_TOKENWe need to clean up the article. The sections should only treat what it says they do in the section title. For example, there shouldn't be a paragraph ``NEWLINE_TOKEN:``In everyday speech, race is often used to describe populations that are better defined as ethnic groups...``NEWLINE_TOKENat the end of ``History of the term``.

Essentially the same method is still used today, at least in this increasingly anti-scientific nation, by dentists who want to match ceramic material used for making fillings with the color of their patient's tooth. They have a little cabinet full of ceramic ``teeth`` on little spindles. Each specimen has a different combination of hue and brightness from the others. Although one could easily create an electronic device to measure these factors to tighter tolerances, the low-tech device seems to meet professional standards. Similarly, given the fact that a subject's skin color could vary considerably due to contingent factors such as season and weather patterns, the von Luchan tiles probably provide all the accuracy that is useful. `",1

There are quotes from Zionist rabbis on this page that are indistinguishable from the logic of Hamas clerics. The denial of Zionism's genocidal intent and practice is similar to Nazis who denied the Holocaust and Final Solution even as they conducted it.

What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji.

I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again.

Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong.

Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again.

The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the ``Palestine Facts`` source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada.

727,"`NEWLINE_TOKENWhat I find, reading these paragraphs, is a decidedly pro-Zayed bias. To assume that anyone who criticizes him in that article must have never went near the Middle East, or the UAE, is preposterous. My own contributions, as well as others, are based on travel and life in the UAE, as well as trustworthy sources like the BBC and Reuters, among others. Also, that he funded all those wonderful projects around the world is not in dispute. To say that it was from his own pocket, however, is ludicrous. As with all the rich Gulf leaders, their personal wealth CAME from the nation's oil wealth. Their checkbooks and the State Treasury were often indistinguishable. Nevertheless, Zayed could have easily chosen to horde the UAE's wealth only for Emiratis, but he didn't, and that is evident. As far as the propaganda pictures and TV footage Falcon44 refers to, I have seen it with my own eyes. It does not negate what he did, but it's important to edify readers that Media in the UAE is strictly controlled, and cult-worship of the ruling families was institutionalized. Again, this does not mean that Zayed was not genuinely liked and admired, but it is important to state all the facts. The simple fact is that there was not one jot of criticism allowed on the airwaves or in print. This is no great slur on Zayed or the UAE. The only 3 relatively lively and free presses in the Arab world are Lebanon, Egypt, and pre-war Kuwait. Qatar is just now experimenting with free media. Regardless, what is more evidence of a pro-Zayed bias then the systematic removal of every scrap of criticism from the article? Why do certain individuals not want the world to know that one of his weddings is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive ever? Why are they afraid to let people know that Zayed's ``election`` to the Presidency was by a mere group of 6 sheiks and not by a free and popular vote? All these facts were shamelessly deleted several times from the article. THAT is what I call bias. Also, you quoted one of his advisors. It is not very shocking that such a person would be overflowing with praise about his employer and benefactor. I do not consider that an objective source. That doesn't mean it cannot be mentioned. As long as it is made clear who said it, the readers can draw their own conclusions about the possible bias of the quotation.  Perhaps you should include that quotation in the article, Falcon. Also, regarding the Zayed Center, that was not my contribution, but I find it very interesting. What you mentioned about it in this talk section is very important. I look forward to you expanding on how he founded the center, and why he became disenchanted with it and withdrew his support.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh, incidentally, it would be a great help if you, and all contributors, made use of the ``edit summary`` section so that the rest of us can more efficiently keep track of who added/deleted what and for what reason.

Remember - no comment required.   ,1
790,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne reason given was that the posts were anonymous.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis was dismissed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSomeone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThat too was dismissed.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTherefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTwo choices.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStop posting completelyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTry and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHence the challenge.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFinally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers.

For example, the ring over tau_p is not isomorphic to the ring x^n^p which is what you seem to be implying; the degrees of polynomials are totatlly different: if P(tau) is a polynomial, then  n^(deg P(tau)) = deg P(x) one is kind-of-like the exp/ad of the other, sort-of.

Mao killed 38 million human beings, Stalin at least 25 million and Hitler at least 20 million. The figures are there on the CIA website. It is unacceptable to show Stalin and Mao as politicians on Wikipedia website when Hitler is depicted as a monster. All of them were equally monsters and the personal cult communism was no differenct from nazism in essence.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou need to be aware that most former eastern bloc countries banned the use and display of the five-pointed red star and the hammer and sickle symbols of communism alongside the swastika and some local fascist sysmbols, because they know from personal experience that the horrors of stalinism were no less than that of nazism. The hungarian law banning all these is the XLV. (45th) law of 1993, titled ``Az önkényuralmi jelképek használatát tiltó törvény`` and it has been upheld in constitutional court.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you fail to mention the very criminality of Stalin and Mao in the very header of their wiki articles, then you are looking for an edit war, period.

We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new Uncle Joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENStalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945``. You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a ``hard earned victory in WWII``.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism.

825,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Ross Perot and the Reform Party ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI edited to include Ross Perot because his candidacy everywhere was talked about as appealing to the 'radical middle' (in the press even). He said he was a social moderate and fiscal conservative, but his general tone was of centrismwhich is why for years after 'swing voters'/centrist voters/independents were called 'Perot voters'. On most issues he came to compromises between Democrats and Republicans with hard solutions. For instance he said both tax cuts and tax increases were needed. He also felt that partisanship and gridlock between the parties caused most problems, including incessant debates on social issues like abortion. But he promoted issues that appealed to the center (that weren't just plain 'centrist' but pro-active positions that at that time hadn't been talked about much before) like balanced budgets, campaign finance reform, referendums, term limits, etc.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Reform Party was based on this platform and was radically centristmembers even called themselves 'centrist'. People in the party felt there were definite issues that needed to be solved, and the two major parties had to be challenged to solve them, with the creation of a new party. Today, many might say the party has a chink in this line of thought, because after Pat Buchanan and his supporters entered the party in the 2000 election, hard stances on immigration started to enter party platforms.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhich is somewhat right-but even still it doesn't compromise on the idea. I read Noam Chomsky once wrote that in America the groups on the fringes of politicslike Nader on the left, Buchanan on the right, and Perot in the center, agreed substantially on their significant issuesand he proposed that they joined together in a pretzel to form the 'radical middle'. A radical 'centrist' is an uneasy concept, since politics always changes and what will be moderate will change. The idea here though is that there is a growing set of issues that is not shared by left or right parties (fair trade, campaign finance reform, balanced budgets). That those who support these issues also carry different baggage of their own, tied to left-right positions, like Buchanan with abortion or immigration, should be expected.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you're talking about John McCain, he plays to many of these positions (but is still free trade). But he's usually still what you might call a 'sensible' centrist and usually falls on the right, where he is. I was in the Reform Party (i think my analysis is accurate so don't bring up the bias), and many members hated McCain because he was a 'false reformer'-for instance his McCain-Feingold act made it even harder for third parties, while not doing anything substantial for reform. The sentiment was that he was just taking advantage of the issues for his public image. If you even listen to his speeches on reform he gives no substance just uses the phrase 'special interests' liberally.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrom what I know about UK politics, Tony Blair looks more like Clintonesque centrism (which is purely political) than anything else.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN ",0

They planned to create a HAL-like computer that understands and answers your questions. In my opinion, internet was the disruptive technology. Rather than making each computer a silicon Alber Einstein, countless dumb computers are connected and each of them has a human brain or database attached to it. Your computer still knows nothing, but some people behind their equally dumb compuers may have your answer.   `",1

He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by ``kind ol' Uncle Joe`` babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a ``dictator`` per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN4., Did Stalin murder his wife?

A salt or acid contaminant level exceeding that of even 100 parts per trillion (ppt) in ultrapure water will begin to noticably raise its conductivity level by up to several hundred kilosiemens per meter.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, I know wikipedia must conform to standards, a policy which I am an ardent advocate of, and the meter is the SI unit of length as is the kilohm. However, ultrapure water is never, ever referred to using these units.

939,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAndy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?",1

942,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Ward Churchill is Not An Indian ==NEWLINE_TOKENI am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all ``Eichmann's.`` Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah `",1

Somebody named dpdsmith took it down and claimed that it was a ``one time only joke mascot created by a campus humor magazine.`` While Keggy the Keg was created by Dartmouth's humor magazine, he is in fact the mascot of Dartmouth College.  Keggy was conceive partially out of the student body’s growing disgust by the ever increasing ineptitude of the current college administration and it’s over zealous attempts to ban and censor anything and everything that could possibly offend anyone. Keggy is by no means a “one time only joke.” He made his debut at the homecoming football game of ’03 and since has attended almost every football game and most hockey games.  Students all over campus can be seen sporting the attractive Keggy T-shirts which depict the lovable fellow drinking from his own tap and have the words “Get Pumped,” and “Go Kegs” written on them.  Further evidence of Keggy’s legitimacy can be seen by that fact that snow sculpture for the most recent Dartmouth Winter Carnival (’05) was an enormous pirate ship which was christened “Captain Keggy’s Carnival Cruiser” by the student assembly.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile Keggy may not be recognized as the official mascot by perversely politically correct and out-of-touch-with-reality administrators, Keggy instantly reached iconic status at his first homecoming game, and has since found a permanent place in the hearts of the sons and daughters of Dartmouth.`",0
959,"`::Dear , Ward Churchill admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of TV cameras, last night, February 22, 2005, that he is NOT in fact an Indian.  He has been lying about his heritage for many, many years and people like me, who live and work in Indian Country everyday, have known for years that he was out and out lying about his heritage.  I repeat:  Ward Churchill during his speech at the University of Hawaii admitted that he is NOT an Indian.  The comment, word for word, was published in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Vol. 10, Issue 54Wednesday, February 23, 2005 Churchill attacks essay’s critics by Craig Gima.

But more importantly the way that the section on his fake Indian heritage needs to be completely re-written.  Considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in Indian Country who dared to question his Indian heritage claims over the years, I think that Indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming.  So many peoplewho do NOT even live in Indian Country, who do NOT work in Indian Countrymade the claim that to dare question the great Ward Churchill's fake Indian heritage was a ``cheap shot.``  We have been hearing that from non-Indians for many, many years and now Churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years.  He claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters.  That is a damn lie too.  He has been claiming Indian heritage for over 20 years.  It is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books.  He refers to the fake Indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article.  He committed fraud when he applied to the University of Colorado.  The Denver Post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is Indian for affirmation action purposes.  That is a damned lie.

961,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Some personal observations here: ==NEWLINE_TOKENPut a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   ",0

You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of ``unsigned`` motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the ``parent`` motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short ``spur`` motorway actually links two different motorways.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf it is part of the M65, as the ``start of restrictions`` sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state ``M61 (M65)``, meaning a part of the M61?

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the ``start of restrictions`` sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states ``A57(M)``, but the DfT documentation states otherwise.

979,"Ignoring the question of how long it will take to actually use it all up, I am prepared to concede the point that if the modern increase rate in CO2 can be extrapolated to burning all known reserves then that would put us at about 700 ppm or less (2.5 times preindustrial levels).  Now, there is a big if in there since we don't really know how existing carbon sinks like soils, forests, and the oceans will respond to increasing CO2.  Right now, these systems buffer the atmosphere so that the annual increase at Mauna Lao is actually significantly lower (by about 50%) than if you just calculate the increase expected from all the CO2 humans dump into the atmosphere.  Basically because CO2 has increased, these systems draw down more CO2 than they did in preindustrial times and hence partially offset our pollution.  Some scientists think this buffer will become ever more effective as CO2 rises, others think it will saturate and a substantially lower fraction of our waste will be absorbed.  Obviously, such uncertainties are important for figuring out max CO2.NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Taking for the moment a value of 700 ppm as a reasonable end point, that still seems potentially bad.  How bad probably depends on how sensitive things like thermohaline circulation are to multiple degree changes in temperature, and how big a feedback is associated with retreating sea ice and permafrost.  Not exactly a risk I am eager to take given existing climate uncertainties.  However, at face value it would seem to take some disasterous scenarios off the table.  For example, it is estimated that the wholesale deglaciation of Antarctica won't occur till 3-3.5 times preindustrial CO2 levels.  (This was presented at a conference of the American Geophysical Union, but I am having trouble finding a reference).NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I think your consideration of how high can CO2 levels really get is a valid one, and potentially very intersting.

The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some ``real Arab`` from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of ``al-Qushayri`` roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).

Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of ``cleansing actions``, ``master races`` and ``aryanism`` were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  ``Judaism:  evils of``; ``Judaism, need for dissolution of``.  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, ``that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .``  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not ``Nazis``  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.

But I'm taking classes right now at Moorpark Junior College, which takes it's main pull of students from Simi Valley/Moorpark/Camarillo. Many of those people seem quite content with the fact that they AREN'T part of Los Angeles and are quite happy to remind people as much. They consider it to be a better ``cleaner`` life where they are and wouldn't want to become part of the city of Los Angeles even if given the chance. Beyond that, they simply aren't residents of Los Angeles or the Greater L.A. area even if they proclaim to be, regardless of what any resident or tourist alike would prefer to believe or tell people. By that logic, San Diego residents may as well start calling themselves Los Angeles residents, since San Deigo doesn't take much longer to get to from my house (about 3 hours) than does LAX (which can take 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours to reach in rush hour traffic).`",1

Notably, he copied the introductory text from the first article into his version of the article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Nations that only share a land border with one other country often have concerns about domination by the other state if it is larger. These can be fears of an outright take-over as has happened historically to such states as East Timor, which was part of Indonesia until very recently, and Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom until 1921. Today concerns are often about economic domination as with the Canada/United States relationship or the Denmark/Germany one. Because much trade goes over land these countries are often heavily reliant on their single neighbour.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn addition, he added the ``merge`` request with the above page within the same edit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBack in this page, he also added the ``merge`` request at 03:11, 4 Feb 2005NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN===Merged===NEWLINE_TOKENBy 18:57, 7 Feb 2005,  fulfilled the merger request.

NEWLINE_TOKEN:No, the transcript does not say that.  Schiavo makes it quite clear that it has nothing to do with the Schindlers.   SCHIAVO: If I moved on with my life — and I moved on with a portion of it — but I still have a big commitment to Terri. I made her a promise...And another reason why I won't give Terri back is that Mr. Schindler testified in court, at the 2000 trial, that he would — to keep Terri alive he would cut her arms and legs off and put her on a ventilator just to keep her alive...It's not about the money. This is about Terri. It's not about the Schindlers, it's not about the legislators, it's not about me, it's about what Terri Schiavo wanted. I am in the process of tracking down this testimony, as I recall reading parts of it in another article.   |  NEWLINE_TOKEN::Ok, here it is, from the December 2003 report to Governor Bush by Dr. Jay Wolfson from the University of South Florida:NEWLINE_TOKEN:::Testimony provided by members of the Schindler family included very personal statements about their desire and intention to ensure that Theresa remain alive.  Throughout the course of the litigation, deposition and trial testimony by members of the Schindler family voiced the disturbing belief that they would keep Theresa alive at any and all costs.  Nearly gruesome examples were given, eliciting agreement by family members that in the event Theresa should contract diabetes and subsequent gangrene in each of her limbs, they would agree to amputate each limb, and would then, were she to be diagnosed with heart disease, perform open heart surgery.  There was additional, difficult testimony that appeared to establish that despite the sad and undesirable condition of Theresa, the parents still derived joy from having her alive, even if Theresa might not be at all aware of her environment given the persistent vegetative state.  'Within the testimony, as part of the hypotheticals presented, Schindler family members stated that even if Theresa had told them of her intention to have artificial nutrition withdrawn, they would not do it. Throughout this painful and difficult trial, the family acknowledged that Theresa was in a diagnosed persistent vegetative state.  |  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::: Uhm, how does Mr. Schindler saying that he would cut her arms and legs off not represent that statement? I'm not understanding where your quibble is... the testimony? The statement about amputation? ``a`` key reason vs. ``the`` key reason? Please explain why you removed the text, as I'm not seeing a clear explanation.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::The editor wrote that the statement in question was a key reason for denying transfer of guardianship to them.  The transcript does not say that.  If anything, Schiavo makes it clear that this is one reason directly connected to the Schindler's inability (probably for religious reasons) to respect Terri's wishes.  The quote in Wolfson's report makes that clear, but Schiavo only alludes to the testimony in the transcript.  Also, Michael Schiavo further clarifies in the transcript that this is not about what he wants, but about what Terri Schiavo wanted.  The statement that was removed from the article attempted to distort these facts.  Further, the statement by the Schindlers has been put to rest on page 34 of Wolfson's report:Of the Schindlers, there has evolved the unfortunate and inaccurate perception that they will ``keep Theresa alive at any and all costs`` even if that were to result in her limbs being amputated and additional, complex surgical and medical interventions being performed, and even if Theresa had expressly indicated her intention not to be so maintained. During the course of the GAL's [Guardian Ad Litem] investigation, the Schindlers allow that this is not accurate, and that they never intended to imply a gruesome maintenance of Theresa at all costs.   |  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::: Re-added text, with efforts to manage such issues, feel free to adjust as needed!  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::With respect to the statement that Michael Schiavo said in a transcript that ``this`` (ending her life) ``is not about what he wants, but about what Terri Schiavo wanted,`` it is important to note that he said exactly the opposite in a sworn deposit",0

First of all if we did not allow POV in external links we'd have to remove half the external links in Wikipedia. Secondly, all film reviews are, by definition, POV (I don't know of any reviews that don't express an opinion) so we'd have to remove all links to film reviews if NPOV applied to external links. We don't remove links simply because of the politics of the site linked to. I think you also misunderstand the concept of ``vandalism``. We can't simply throw around the term to justify removal of any material we don't like. It applies specifically to activity that disrupts wikipedia or disrupts an article. I've seen MIM reviews quoted in Harper's so they are actually relatively well known if only for their amusement value. There is no reason why we shouldn't have external links to Christian film reviews or Marxist film reviews. A broad variety of links is encouraged. What's discouraged are repetitive links to similar material (eg reviews from a dozen daily newspapers would be repetitive). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs to your point about ideology, I don't know if you've ever studied film theory in university or read academic journals on film such as cahiers des cinema but serious film criticism does actually deal with ideology, subtext etc and is not just the ``thumbs up`` ``thumbs down`` type review you see in a newspaper. By your argument we couldn't link to serious scholarly articles on films, many of which ``deconstruct`` films from a Marxist, feminist, postmodern, or other ideological perspective. For instance, Susan Sontag's important and influential writings on film would be banned, by your argument, as they are ideological in nature and explore the subtext of films rather than simply being a technical critique. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHope this clarifies things.

1281,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: I agree that some of the examples here are somewhat fluffy.  But emergence means slightly different things in different fields.  For example, while physicists use the term emergence, it doesn't have the same hype attached to it as the term does in the behavioural sciences.  It's simply used to mean a phenomenon or concept which only makes sense, or behaves in an expected way, at macroscopic scales (in space or time) but not at microscopic scales.  Thus questions like ``is this electron hot or cold?  blue or green?  soft or hard?  smooth or rough?  solid or liquid?`` have little or no useful meaning, because these concepts are emergent and thus do not apply in this setting (or if they do apply, they behave unexpectedly and so one's intuition on the concept may be very misleading here).  That's a helpful thing to keep in mind, it lets one avoid any number of elementary errors when trying to understand particle physics, and thus does have a non-trivial amount of explanatory power.  As for mathematics (which is my own profession), I've almost never seen the term ``emergence`` used... the closest analogues seem to be the distinction between ``local`` and ``non-local`` (or ``global``) concepts, or between ``asymptotic`` and ``non-asymptotic`` behaviour.  It is true, I would classify most of the mathematical examples here as examples of non-local concepts rather than emergent ones.  If I have some time I might try to rework some of the mathematical material (which I was not involved in earlier).   `",0

Kirin is romanised according to the dialect around Jilin at a different stage that is why it is not calle Katlam. By the way, you are really offensive by blocking me yesterday.

1294,"I agree with you. I am a Chinese contributor to this site and I speak 3 Chinese vernaculars and 3 European languages and through some of the unreasonable Mandarinization imposed here, I feel how repressed non-native Mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. Traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into Chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. In USA and Europe, it is mostly by the Cantonese, then subsequently The Minnan-Taiwanese and recently the people for Fuzhou, Wenzhou etc. As such, they will use Han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like English. There is no standardised version until the Northerners came into power and imposed Mandarin on all the other Chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. I think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of Chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the ORIGINAL, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the Mandarin version. That will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary Mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes.

What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: ``Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.`` There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.`` He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. NEWLINE_TOKENThe Torah states that the prophet that will arrive ``from the midst of thee`` is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: ``I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God.`` As it says: ``Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.`` Deuteronomy 13:1. NEWLINE_TOKEN``A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.`` Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known. The sentence quoted above was taken from a paragraph in Deuteronomy that specifically warns the Jewish people about the prohibitions of soothsaying, astrology, divination, sorcery, etc. The Gentiles believe they can manipulate and use these practices in ord",0

1435,"`NEWLINE_TOKEN::Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with that. I'm from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, myself. I've been in France and other European countries back in the disco era, and what we call ``disco`` is encompassing much more than what is being made of it here. For instance, loads of really good disco music was made in Italy, Germany, France and even here in The Netherlands, because there was a lot of money in mafia to buy the early synthesizers. Moroder, for one, was an Italian living in Munich when the Donna Summer hits were created I believe. Disco to us here therefore also includes music by Gino Soccio, Cowley, Moroder himself (not only his Donna Summer work) plus many Italian producers. When I see this page, it's as if Europe didn't influence the genre, while it is the other way around in many ways. It wasn't Chicago or London where house-music started, even, the first fast-paced housey acidy music came from Italy, Germany and The Netherlands if you ask me. Take for example 'Remember' by Vivien Vee from 1977, and 'Crazy Family' by Jock Hattle, the long version from 1982. They both have long-lasting breaks in them, perfect examples of disco that would now be called ``house`` or maybe even ``trance`` for parts of them.`",0
