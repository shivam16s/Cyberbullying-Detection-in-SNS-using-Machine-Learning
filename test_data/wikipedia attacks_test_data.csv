1,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Warning ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is clearly a protectionist regime going on here and a witch hunt to boot. The duck rule has been abused to effect this. The article Jonathan Mitchell isn't promotional as that IP that is NOT me claims. It's not notable. As I have been blocked for false reasons, I give notice that I am consulting my lawyers for slander by the blocking admin and reviewing admins. Delete the Jonathan Mitchell article. He's not notable. I maintain that I have not socked but you lot refuse to believe the truth. Well it will likely be sorted out in a court room now. You can re-block this account for legal threats if you want. I will not be slandered and if making the warning is blockable conduct then so be it.   ",personal attack
2,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThese sources don't exactly exude a sense of impartiality. Newsweek is a *better* start, but it still is an article written by someone with an ax to grind (Would an article from Breitbart be as easily accepted? I hope not) but that page from that Massanari woman seems a bit lacking, especially considering it uses such an inflammatory, biased word as ``toxic`` in its own abstract.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI doubt my words will have much effect since the consensus by wiki admins (the only ones who really matter around here) seems to be stuck-in-place, but for anyone else reading this, consider the damn sources. Single studies, politicos writting polemics, etc. etc.   `",personal attack

5,"NEWLINE_TOKEN::I'm talking about you making unjustified major changes. In this  edit. Did you just restore ``caused criticism`` in the lede? No. No, you didn't. You reverted to your own preferred wording (removing sources etc in the process) the entire ``Election of Constitutional Court Judges`` section. Does that diff look like you're just restoring two words to the lede? I don't know, maybe somebody slipped something in  my coffee this morning, but that sure as hell does not look like just restoring two words to the lede, so please, cut it out.NEWLINE_TOKEN::And speaking of WP:BATTLEGROUND and WP:GAME here is the context:NEWLINE_TOKEN::I edit the ``Election of Constitutional Court Judges`` section to clarify, provide info and fix some blatant mistakes.NEWLINE_TOKEN::You blindly revert within minutes claiming it's ``unsourced`` even though most of the text you added to the article was unsourced as well.NEWLINE_TOKEN::I add sources . You complain about the refs being just bare urls. Which is a valid criticism... if you hadn't blindly reverted within minutes, not even giving me the chance to fill out the refs.NEWLINE_TOKEN::I, others, fill out the refs.NEWLINE_TOKEN::You revert anyway with an edit summary ``ce, restore`` , effectively pretending your edit is just some minor grammar corrections, rather than blatant edit warring.NEWLINE_TOKEN::So. I add text, you complain about lack of sources and revert, I add sources, you complain about formatting and revert, the refs are formatted to your specifications, you revert anyway under the disguise of a ``copy edit``. Now. Who's playing WP:GAMEs and who's got the WP:BATTLEGROUND mentality here?   NEWLINE_TOKEN`",personal attack
6,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== hi Drmies ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy name's Little Cletus, I'm just here to teach you about Internet manners. For starters, don't go around threatening people if they change an article multiple times back to the way it should be. It's extremely rude and inconsiderate. Especially when it was originally their page. Just a friendly reminder that's all!NEWLINE_TOKENLittle Cletus signing out   ",personal attack
7,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI had to chop out a section specifically comparing the Calormenes with Muslims. There are numerous dark-skinned races in the world, not all of whom are Muslim. Not even all Arabic people are Muslim. And there is more evidence that Lewis based the Calormene god Tash on the false gods of the Old Testament, rather than Allah. If one reads the epic books the Arabian Nights and the Shahnama, I think they will find rather close resemblances between the characters/styles and the Calormenes.

8,"`NEWLINE_TOKEN: your reply from my talk page: OOps, no â€” I just looked at the User page, saw that it was a bot, and added the designation.    NEWLINE_TOKENSorry, I think you misunderstood.  I wasn't saying this was an oops.  FlaBot is a bot.  I was simply offering an explanation of how the bot indication was missing. I think it is appropriate for the edits from this account to be marked as ``bot edits``.  Thanks for doing it.     `",Non personal attack
